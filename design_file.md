App description:

Home: The user is able to sign up/ sign in using email and password, once they sign up there are prompted to enter information such as name, then they can pick between three roles, farmer, contractor, or buyer. Based on the role they select the app would look different.

FOR FARMERS:

The farmer should have three tabs, plant/inventory/sell/jobs

The vision for the plant tab is to help farmers optimize their agricultural output, I want the farmers to be able to block out where their farm is using some kind of map, select what they want to plant. Then i want to use some forms of llm to give feedback to help optimize output and a timeline on how long in will take. From there i want the farmer to be able to accept the plan and once they harvest the crop put it in their inventory tab.

From their inventory tab, I want the farmer to be able to put crops for sale, specifictly i want to build a unit sale system where different farmers can put together their crops and sell it at wholesale prices.

I also want the farmers to be able to post jobs for the jobs section of the contractors

FOR CONTRACTORS:

They need to be able to see the jobs posted by the farmers, and apply for it.

FOR BUYERS:

THey need to be able to see the crops that farmers are selling and buy those crops
